# Noreasth Airlines Mobile App

This repository contains the code for a flight booking application designed for mobile platforms. The app allows users to search for flights, manage their profile, view upcoming flights, and sign in or create an account.

## Main Views
The app consists of several main views:

### Home
The Home view is the starting point of the app. Users can search for flights by specifying the departure and arrival locations, dates, number of passengers, and other preferences such as one-way trips, non-stop flights, and carry-on inclusion. Users can also sort the results based on various criteria.

### Search Results
The SearchResults view displays the search results based on the user's query. It supports sorting and displays information about each flight option, such as flight number, departure and arrival times, total time, cost, and additional services like Wi-Fi availability.

### SignIn 
The SignInView is used for user authentication. It allows users to sign in with an email and password or navigate to create a new account. It also provides the option to continue as a guest.

### Profile
The Profile view shows the user's personal information, loyalty status, and payment options. Users can edit their profile and view FAQs or sign out.

### MyFlights
The MyFlights view lists all upcoming flights for the user. It provides details about each flight and its current status (e.g., "On Time").

## ViewModel
Each view is backed by a corresponding ViewModel that handles the business logic, such as data validation, sorting options, and managing state changes.
